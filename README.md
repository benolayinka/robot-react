# React Robot Server

### `npm start`

If running locally, the devlopment app is available at localhost:3000. <br />
If running on the server, nginx should redirect dev.hotstname.com to hostname.com:3000 where the app is listening. See config at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default<br />
If you're editing via ssh, sometimes the number of file listeners exceeds the system capacity. If the dev environment doesnt recompile on file change, read this: https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code/issues/29

## Getting All The Packages

This project uses some bit.dev packages, so before doing `npm i`, you have to do `npm config set @bit:registry https://node.bit.dev`

### Modifying the scene in ../src/3d/CannonScene.js

CannonScene uses Three.js to render, and Cannon.js to simulate physics.
Check the CannonScene class constructor function to see how things are created.
Look at objects like Cloud or Sun for simple examples.
Most objects in the world have a 
this.mesh - the visual object 
this.body - the physics body

If you don't need physics for an element (like the Clouds and Sun) it's okay to just have a this.mesh

CannonScene has a this.addObject() method you should use, which automatically adds the object to the THREE Scene, the body to the CANNON World (if the body exists), and handles copying the data from the CANNON to THREE at each this.step()

If you add a .update function to a thing's prototype and use this.addObject, the simulation will automatically call that function at each this.step(), which can be useful for animating stuff. See Sky for an example

For easier debugging of cannon physics, enable cannonDebugRenderer by adding ?debug to the query url (e.g localhost:3000/sim?debug)

## todo
### sim things to fix
set character upright on fall - see Robot.prototype.update, orientation detection is there<br />
create a nicer looking billboard<br />
create a more interesting level<br />
add points system and HUD<br />

### view things to fix
add a loader with timeout for when robot is not connected<br />
add touch screen interaction for robot<br />
